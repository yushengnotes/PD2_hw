## Program Design 2:  course homework

The code of hw4 will be similar to hw3 due to the hw4 problem is the derivation of hw3.
To be honest, I hadn't finished the hw3 really well so hw3 was unfinish and that I started to write the code on the basis of hw3 to write hw4. That's the reason that they were so similar.
